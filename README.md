# INT104-ML-Anesthesia--Classification
This project applies machine learning classifiers to recommend appropriate anesthesia methods for patients based on their physical condition. The workflow includes data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction (PCA), supervised classification (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes), and unsupervised clustering (K-Means).
